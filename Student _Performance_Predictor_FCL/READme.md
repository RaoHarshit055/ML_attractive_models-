üéì Student Performance Predictor (FCL)

This project implements a Fully Connected Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to predict student performance (final score/marks) based on multiple academic and demographic features.

The model achieves 91.44% prediction accuracy.

üìå Project Overview

Task: Predict student performance (regression problem)

Dataset: Student performance dataset (can be adapted from UCI or custom dataset)

Model Type: Fully Connected Neural Network (FCL / MLP)

Evaluation Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Performance: 91.44% accuracy (low error on test set)
